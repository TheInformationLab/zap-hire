# Zapier Hire by Google App

Integrate with Hire by Google via Zapier.

## Getting Started

Unfortunately as we have no direct affiliation with Google this app cannot appear in the Zapier public gallery.

### Installing

You can however make use of it either by using it as a [beta tester](https://zapier.com/developer/public-invite/24823/f20c92bbde49d6c97aae371525aadd2c/) or by cloning this repo and publishing it to your own Zapier account via the CLI. Further information can be [found here](https://zapier.github.io/zapier-platform-cli/cli.html).
